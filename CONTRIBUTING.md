# Contributing

You are very welcome to contribute to this repository.


## How to contribute?

This can be done in several ways, depending on how familiar you are with
the GitHub workflow:

  * simply send an [email](geertjan.bex@uhasselt.be),
  * [create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/)
    on GitHub, or
  * [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
    on GitHub, create a branch based on the development
    branch, make your contribution, and submit a
    [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

For pull requests, a few things should be noted:

  * you may be asked to modify your contribution to fit better into
    the context,
  * please base them on the development branch,
  * please ensure your branch is in sync with the upstream development
    branch before submitting the pull request,
  * please try to use [informative commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
    (I'm not claiming that mine are shining examples, but well...), and

Of course, although all contributions are very much appreciated, some of
them might not be integrated into the material.  If that should happen,
 I'll try to justify that decision, and it can be discussed.
